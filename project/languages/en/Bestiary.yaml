        The devious and cunning
        oldest SLIME SISTER. Knows
        how to find enjoyment in
        everything. She has mastered
        all the sciences, but sticks
        with programming as it
        requires the least amount of
        movement.

        Is quite fond of
        cheesy potato chips.

        The calm and practical youngest
        SLIME SISTER. Mainly deals with
        liquid elements in vials because
        they are pretty.

        She is an expert at diffusing
        difficult situations since her
        sisters like to argue quite
        frequently.
